1. Make sure that the input.txt file has correct inputs.
	We cannot have multiple Environment elements except : Sumpuw+Wumpus and Sumpuw+Pit in tha same tile.
	Environment elements are: Wumpus, Pit, No Trespass Area, Gold, Sumpuw

2.  There can be multiple "Pits" and multiple "No Trespass Area" but only one "Gold", "Wumpus" and "Summpuw"
 
3.  Input file is in the format:
	PositionofPits 1 3
	PositionofPits 6 1
	PositionOfNoTrespassArea 2 3
	PositionOfWumpus 2 8
	PositionOfSumpuw 2 8
	PositiongOfGold 8 8	
	
	In "PositionofPits 1 3" 1 represents column number and 3 represents row number.
	If you want to add multiple pits, add aother line (e.g. "PositionofPits 1 4") like above. 
	Same logic for all.

4. Agent shoots arrow only after it confirms that there is a wumpus in a tile.
